# NotAnotherVim

*Because we don’t need another Vim clone… but we made one anyway!*

NotAnotherVim is a minimalist, terminal-based text editor that embraces the pure joy of typing, with a dash of command-line nostalgia. It’s built with C and designed to be simple, efficient, and fun. If you're tired of the usual, here’s your chance to experience yet another text editor. But this time, it’s not *just* another one—it's NotAnotherVim.
Yea, finding the name was very hard indeed ;)
